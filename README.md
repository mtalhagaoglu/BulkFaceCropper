## Bulk Face Cropper

This is a Python script that can detect and crop faces from multiple images in bulk using the OpenCV library.

### Prerequisites:

Python 3
OpenCV Python library

### Installation:

Clone the repository to your local machine:

```
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/bulk-face-cropper.git
```

### Install the required dependencies:

```
pip install opencv-python
```

### Usage:

Place all the images that you want to crop in the "input" folder. Make sure that the images are in a format that OpenCV can read (e.g. .jpg, .png).

Run the script by providing the path to the folder containing the images and the output folder where the cropped images will be saved:

python main.py

The script will process each image in the input folder and save the cropped images in the output folder.
